1. 运动时候有白光出现，是不是说明这个运动会对眼睛有伤害，加重现在的问题。
2. 什么样的运动对眼睛有伤害，我可以做什么运动。
3. 告诉医生现在做的运动，问问医生对眼睛有没有负面影响。


Hi, Doctor Or,
  Hope this message finds you well. I visited Doctor Acharya last month. She recommends initiating systemic IMT to prevent further visual loss. Due to the capability an precision limit of the machine, the stability in the exams can not wipe out the possibiity that the problem is still developing. She also said symptoms such as bright lights or photopsias may represent retinal inflammation that is subclinical. I am not sure if you can see her visit notes. If not, please let me know and I can foward the notes to you. We can arrange for a meeting to discuss whether it is necessary to start the treatment. 

Regards,
Weiran


Dear Doctor,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to seek your advice and guidance regarding my eye condition and the medication I have been prescribed. I have several questions I would like to ask you:

1. If I start taking the medication, can you guarantee that my right eye will not deteriorate?
2. How long does the medication treatment last and do I need to take it continuously?
3.  If I take the medication, will it disrupt the current balance and potentially cause my right eye to deteriorate even faster if I stop taking it?
4. What are the side effects of the medication and will it affect any of my organs or my ability to conceive and bear children?
5. How can I monitor the effectiveness of the medication after taking it?
I would greatly appreciate a prompt response to these questions. Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
